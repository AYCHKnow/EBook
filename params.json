{"name":"Sile","tagline":"Simon's Improved Layout Engine","body":"# Simon's Improved Layout Engine\r\n\r\nSILE is a text formatting engine. It's sort of like TeX, except it isn't\r\n35 years old, doesn't use idiosyncratic font and output formats, and it\r\nisn't written in Pascal.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nFirst you will need lua, pango and cairo installed. You will then\r\nneed to run:\r\n\r\n* `luarocks install stdlib lgi lpeg luaexpat inspect luaepnf luarepl cassowary`\r\n\r\nOnce your dependencies are installed, run\r\n\r\n* `lua install.lua`\r\n\r\nThis will place the SILE libraries and executable in a sensible\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nTry `sile examples/test.sil`\r\n\r\n## For more information\r\n\r\nRead the SILE manual in documentation/sile.pdf\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
